    "## 2. Downloading ERA5-Land hourly met data across arbitrary geometries and exporting to ELM\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to sample raw ERA5-Land hourly meteorological data from Google Earth Engine using either points or polygons, then process the downloaded data for export to ELM-ready netCDF files.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a generalization from notebooks `1a` and `1b` that represents a few key improvements:\n",
    "- batching has been implemented so that GEE Tasks are not too large\n",
    "- batching has also been implemented in the post-processing to avoid reading giant files into memory\n",
    "- instead of just points, this code now can also consider polygons. In this case, it will compute the spatial avearge across each polygon\n",
    "- this notebook represents end-to-end processing (as opposed to being split into two like `1a` and `1b`).\n",
    "  \n",
    "Like in `1a`, we will sample from the site locations listed in this [NGEE repo](https://github.com/NGEE-Arctic/cc1_ngee_p4_sites), but we will turn these into polygons to demonstrate sampling over geometries."

    "Second, we can now specify a `gee_scale`. This is the resolution in meters over which GEE should sample the base ERA5-Land hourly data at to perform spatial averaging. You can specify `native` to use the ERA5-Land hourly's native resolution of ~11km, but if you're running bigger polygons, you might want to choose a coarser scale. See [this documentation](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/scale#:~:text=The%20lowest%20level%20of%20the,within%20a%20256x256%20pixel%20tile.) if you have questions about scale implications. We'll just stick with `native` for this test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, we have a parameter that adjusts how big our batch size should be. This parameter is called `gee_years_per_task`, and refers to how many ERA5-Land hourly years each Task sent to GEE should cover. In general, the more geometries you are sampling, the lower you want this number to be. The default of 5 should work OK for a few hundred geometries, but if you're doing thousands of geometries you might want to lower it to 1 or 2. Note that there is an optimal number for this parameter in terms of speed of output, but it's basically unknowable. On your end, tt depends on the size of your job (number of geometries and length of time you sample). On the GEE end (unknowable exactly), it depends on current server loads, task prioritization, and memory constraints. **In general, it is better to run more, smaller Tasks on GEE as opposed to larger, fewer ones.** We will set it to 2 in this example to prove that post-processing batching works just fine :) \n",

    "Fourth, we already constructed `gdf` which contains our polygons to sample. We will feed this directly as part of our `params` dictionary. **However**, if you have many polygons, or if they have lots of vertices, this method will fail as there is a size limit on geometries that you're able to pass directly from the Python API to GEE. Instead, you will need to upload your shapefile to GEE as an Asset. This is very easy to do; see [this documentation](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/manage_assets#code-editor_1). Once you've uploaded it, you can now just provide a string to this parameter that represents the path to the asset--for example, `'projects/ee-jonschwenk/assets/AK_temp_20230530'`. Again, here we will just use our gdf. **Remember that your geometries must have a `gid` field containing unique identifiers for each.** \n",
