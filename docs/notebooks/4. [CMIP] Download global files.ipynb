    "## 4. Downloading global CMIP data\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to download global CMIP6 files based on your criteria (variables, models, experiments, etc.). This notebook only walks through the process of downloading the raw CMIP6 files, not formatting them for ELM [funcationality does not yet exist].\n",
    "\n",
    "`dapper` uses a Pangeo-hosted CMIP repository, as we found that ESGF was kinda tricky because of the transience and availability of nodes. The Pangeo archive standardizes everything into a quickly-searchable and downloadable archive, but it is not a perfect mirror of all the available data across ESGF. If you're not finding what you need here, you may have to look in ESGF. Note that Google Earth Engine also hosts a downscaled set of CMIP6 models/variables, but unfortunately it includes only a limited set of variables--not everything needed for ELM runs, so we do not provide functionality for sampling it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Searching and downloading from the Pangeo archive does not require an account, so unlike ERA5-Land data that needs a Google Earth Engine account, this should work straight out of the box."
