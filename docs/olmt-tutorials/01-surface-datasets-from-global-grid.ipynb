    "# 01 - Using OLMT to create surface files from the global E3SM datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Rich Fiorella, March 11 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "An initial starting point for simulations at a new site should start with a simulation that provides a baseline or control run, using E3SM as it is out of the box, with none of the new NGEE Arctic features turned on, and from the existing land surface boundary condition datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "OLMT has a tool that an create domain, surface, and landuse timeseries boundary condition files to generate these from the half-degree standard datasets used in E3SM v3.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, this notebook only outlines perhaps the simplest way to extract these datasets. There are other ways to provide some simple site-specific data when creating the surface files that are hinted at but not used here currently.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script assumes that you are running somewhere you have access to the dcstorage drive/folder: neon_e3sm/inputdata. Throughout the remainder of this, ${INPUTDATA} assumes you are in this inputdata folder. This houses our local repository of E3SM input data. It is several terabytes, but is a subset of data available here: https://web.lcrc.anl.gov/public/e3sm/inputdata/\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need OLMT for this - I am in the process of moving my OLMT work to GitLab so we can better control what is released outside of LANL. I recommend starting from the GitLab version since that will be getting more frequent updates:\n",
